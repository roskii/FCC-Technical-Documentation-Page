            <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</p>
                <li class="li-main-section">HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.</li>
                <li class="li-main-section">CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.</li>
                <li class="li-main-section">JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</li>
            <br>
            <p>The three layers build on top of one another nicely. Let's take a simple text label as an example. We can mark it up using HTML to give it structure and purpose:</p>
            <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Player 1: Chris&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>Then we can add some CSS into the mix to get it looking nice:</p>
            <pre><code>p {
                font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, sans-serif;
                letter-spacing: 1px;
                text-transform: uppercase;
                text-align: center;
                border: 2px solid rgba(0,0,200,0.6);
                background: rgba(0,0,200,0.3);
                color: rgba(0,0,200,0.6);
                box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,200,0.4);
                border-radius: 10px;
                padding: 3px 10px;
                display: inline-block;
                cursor: pointer;
            }</code></pre>
            <p>And finally, we can add some JavaScript to implement dynamic behaviour:</p>
            <pre><code>const para = document.querySelector('p');

            para.addEventListener('click', updateName);
            
            function updateName() {
            let name = prompt('Enter a new name');
            para.textContent = 'Player 1: ' + name;
            }</code></pre>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="The_Benefits">
            <header>The Benefits<i id="sub-header-icon" class="fas fa-user-ninja"></i></header>
                <p>The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow you to do things like:</p>
                <li class="li-main-section">Store useful values inside variables. In the above example for instance, we ask for a new name to be entered then store that name in a variable called name.</li>
                <li class="li-main-section">Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming). In the above example we take the string "Player 1: " and join it to the name variable to create the complete text label, e.g. ''Player 1: Chris".</li>
                <li class="li-main-section">Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page. We used a click event in our example above to detect when the button is clicked and then run the code that updates the text label.</li>
                <li class="li-main-section">And much more!</li>
                <br>
                <p>What is even more exciting however is the functionality built on top of the client-side JavaScript language. So-called <strong>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)</strong> provide you with extra superpowers to use in your JavaScript code.</p>
                <p>APIs are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to implement programs that would otherwise be hard or impossible to implement. They do the same thing for programming that ready-made furniture kits do for home building — it is much easier to take ready-cut panels and screw them together to make a bookshelf than it is to work out the design yourself, go and find the correct wood, cut all the panels to the right size and shape, find the correct-sized screws, and then put them together to make a bookshelf.</p>
                <p>They generally fall into two categories.</p>
                <li class="li-main-section"><strong>Browser APIs</strong> are built into your web browser, and are able to expose data from the surrounding computer environment, or do useful complex things.</li>
                <li class="li-main-section"><strong>Third party APIs</strong> are not built into the browser by default, and you generally have to grab their code and information from somewhere on the Web.</li>

        <section class="main-section" id="What_Can_It_Do?">
            <header>What Can It Do?<i id="sub-header-icon" class="fas fa-user-ninja"></i></header>
                <p>Here we'll actually start looking at some code, and while doing so, explore what actually happens when you run some JavaScript in your page.</p>
                <p>Let's briefly recap the story of what happens when you load a web page in a browser (first talked about in our How CSS works article). When you load a web page in your browser, you are running your code (the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) inside an execution environment (the browser tab). This is like a factory that takes in raw materials (the code) and outputs a product (the web page).</p>
                <p>A very common use of JavaScript is to dynamically modify HTML and CSS to update a user interface, via the Document Object Model API (as mentioned above). Note that the code in your web documents is generally loaded and executed in the order it appears on the page. If the JavaScript loads and tries to run before the HTML and CSS it is affecting has been loaded, errors can occur. You will learn ways around this later in the article, in the Script loading strategies section.</p>
            <h3>Browser Security</h3>
                <p>Each browser tab has its own separate bucket for running code in (these buckets are called "execution environments" in technical terms) — this means that in most cases the code in each tab is run completely separately, and the code in one tab cannot directly affect the code in another tab — or on another website. This is a good security measure — if this were not the case, then pirates could start writing code to steal information from other websites, and other such bad things.</p>
            <blockquote><strong>Note: </strong> There are ways to send code and data between different websites/tabs in a safe manner, but these are advanced techniques that we won't cover in this course.</blockquote>
            <h3>JavaScript Running Order</h3>
                <p>When the browser encounters a block of JavaScript, it generally runs it in order, from top to bottom. This means that you need to be careful what order you put things in. For example, let's return to the block of JavaScript we saw in our first example:</p>
            <pre><code>const para = document.querySelector('p');

            para.addEventListener('click', updateName);
            
            function updateName() {
                let name = prompt('Enter a new name');
                para.textContent = 'Player 1: ' + name;
            }</code></pre>
                <p>Here we are selecting a text paragraph (line 1), then attaching an event listener to it (line 3) so that when the paragraph is clicked, the <code>updateName()</code> code block (lines 5–8) is run. The <code>updateName()</code> code block (these types of reusable code blocks are called "functions") asks the user for a new name, and then inserts that name into the paragraph to update the display.</p>
                <p>If you swapped the order of the first two lines of code, it would no longer work — instead, you'd get an error returned in the browser developer console — <code>TypeError: para is undefined</code>. This means that the <code>para</code> object does not exist yet, so we can't add an event listener to it.</p>
            <blockquote><strong>Note: </strong> This is a very common error — you need to be careful that the objects referenced in your code exist before you try to do stuff to them.</blockquote>

        <section class="main-section" id="How_To_Add_It?">
            <header>How To Add It?<i id="sub-header-icon" class="fas fa-user-ninja"></i></header>
                <p>JavaScript is applied to your HTML page in a similar manner to CSS. Whereas CSS uses <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> elements to apply external stylesheets and <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> elements to apply internal stylesheets to HTML, JavaScript only needs one friend in the world of HTML — the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element. Let's learn how this works:</p>
            <h3>Internal JavaScript</h3>
            <li class="li-main-section">First of all, make a local copy of our example file apply-javascript.html. Save it in a directory somewhere sensible.</li>
            <li class="li-main-section">Open the file in your web browser and in your text editor. You'll see that the HTML creates a simple web page containing a clickable button.</li>
            <li class="li-main-section">Next, go to your text editor and add the following in your head — just before your closing <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code> tag:</li>
            <br>
            <pre><code>&lt;script&gt;

            // JavaScript goes here
        
            &lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
            <li class="li-main-section">Now we'll add some JavaScript inside our <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element to make the page do something more interesting — add the following code just below the "// JavaScript goes here" line:</li>
            <br>
            <pre><code>&lt;document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
            function createParagraph() {
            let para = document.createElement('p');
            para.textContent = 'You clicked the button!';
            document.body.appendChild(para);
            }
        
            const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('button');
        
            for(let i = 0; i < buttons.length ; i++) {
            buttons[i].addEventListener('click', createParagraph);
            }
            });</code></pre>
            <li class="li-main-section">Save your file and refresh the browser — now you should see that when you click the button, a new paragraph is generated and placed below.</li>
            <br>
            <blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> If your example doesn't seem to work, go through the steps again and check that you did everything right. Did you save your local copy of the starting code as a .html file? Did you add your <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element just before the <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code> tag? Did you enter the JavaScript exactly as shown? <strong>JavaScript is case sensitive, and very fussy, so you need to enter the syntax exactlot work.</strong></blockquote>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Using_Comments">
            <header>Using Comments<i id="sub-header-icon" class="fas fa-user-ninja"></i></header>
            <p>As with HTML and CSS, it is possible to write comments into your JavaScript code that will be ignored by the browser, and exist simply to provide instructions to your fellow developers on how the code works (and you, if you come back to your code after six months and can't remember what you did). Comments are very useful, and you should use them often, particularly for larger applications. There are two types:</p>
            <li class="li-main-section">A single line comment is written after a double forward slash (//), e.g.</li>
            <br>
                <pre><code>// I am a comment</code></pre>
            <li class="li-main-section">A multi-line comment is written between the strings /* and */, e.g.</li>
            <br>
            <pre><code>/*
            I am also
            a comment
            */</code></pre>
            <p>So for example, we could annotate our last demo's JavaScript with comments like so:</p>
            <pre><code>
            // Function: creates a new paragraph and appends it to the bottom of the HTML body.

            function createParagraph() {
            let para = document.createElement('p');
            para.textContent = 'You clicked the button!';
            document.body.appendChild(para);
            }

            /*
            1. Get references to all the buttons on the page in an array format.
            2. Loop through all the buttons and add a click event listener to each one.

            When any button is pressed, the createParagraph() function will be run.
            */

            const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('button');

            for (let i = 0; i < buttons.length ; i++) {
            buttons[i].addEventListener('click', createParagraph);
            }
            </code></pre>
            <blockquote><strong>Note: </strong>In general more comments are usually better than less, but you should be careful if you find yourself adding lots of comments to explain what variables are (your variable names perhaps should be more intuitive), or to explain very simple operations (maybe your code is overcomplicated).</blockquote>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Summary">
            <header>Summary<i id="sub-header-icon" class="fas fa-user-ninja"></i></header>
                <p>So there you go, your first step into the world of JavaScript. We've begun with just theory, to start getting you used to why you'd use JavaScript and what kind of things you can do with it. Along the way, you saw a few code examples and learned how JavaScript fits in with the rest of the code on your website, amongst other things.

                JavaScript may seem a bit daunting right now, but don't worry — in this course, we will take you through it in simple steps that will make sense going forward. In the next article, we will plunge straight into the practical, getting you to jump straight in and build your own JavaScript examples.</p>
